# PYTHON FOR EVERYBODY SPECIALISATION ON COURSERA.
Python For Everybody specialization course is offered by University of Michigan. I completed this specialization course on the Coursera Platform.

## About the Repository
This repository is a collection of the assignments (excluding quizzes) I worked on and submitted. The repository is created with an intent of archiving my codes and keeping track of my progress.

## ABOUT THE SPECIALIZATION COURSE
The specialization contains 5 courses as enumerated below:
 1. [Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python)
 2. [Python Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python)
 3. [Using Python to Access Web Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data?specialization=python)
 4. [Using Databases with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-databases?specialization=python)
 5. [Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-visualization?specialization=python)

The course covers crucial programming concepts, database (DBMS), data analysis and visualization concepts. The assignments and quizzes of each concept are required to be submitted and passed for successful completion of the specialization.

As someone who is switching careers from a non-technical field to computer science, I found the course, specifically the brilliant lectures of Professor Charles Severance, to be immensely helpful in gaining practical knowledge in programming and related concepts.
